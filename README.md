Preprocessing performs the preprocessing of the original data into preprocessed train and test, stored in datasets folder.

Models contains tryouts for models. 

Best pos is 295 now (a little bit tuned xgb).

Untested on the platform: None

Further ToDo:

Max: Ensemble over Boosting

Dan: Catboost tuning

Further further ToDo: 
ensemple over 2x1 over xgb and catboost,depending on which score is higher.
NN implementation.

Ensembling of many simple 1-pack boostings. Ensemble with RF.


TARGET ENCODING. A little bit of mess with preprocessing needed, leakages may occur.
